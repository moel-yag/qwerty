To fully understand the export builtin function in your minishell, you should learn about:

Shell Environment Variables

What environment variables are and how they are used in Unix shells.
How export makes variables available to child processes.
C Strings and String Manipulation

How to parse and split strings in C (e.g., finding = in VAR=value).
How to check if a string is a valid variable name (letters, digits, underscores, not starting with a digit).
Linked Lists in C

How environment variables are stored as a linked list (t_env).
How to traverse, update, and add nodes to a linked list.
Memory Management in C

How to allocate, duplicate, and free memory for strings and structs.
Sorting Algorithms (optional)

How to sort a list or array of environment variables for display.
Shell Builtin Behavior

The difference between built-in commands and external programs.
How export behaves in bash/zsh (e.g., export VAR=value, export VAR, export with no arguments).
Recommended topics to study:

C pointers and dynamic memory
String functions (strchr, strdup, etc.)
Linked list basics
POSIX shell variable rules
How environment variables are inherited by child processes
Understanding these concepts will help you read, modify, and extend your export builtin implementation.
